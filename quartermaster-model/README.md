# Non-functional Property Coupling Quartermaster models

Use [Quartermaster](https://github.com/BYU-SE/quartermaster) to model and explore coupling of non-functional properties (NFP).

## Installation

To explore and develop locally, you can clone this repository. Then, run `npm i` to install dependencies. The models are written in TypeScript.

## Usage

```
npm start
```

The `cluster_start.ts` file spins up a primary record keeper and several workers which drive the simulations, that utilize values from `out/case-studies/param-values.txt` and `out/case-studies/simulation.json` to know what simulations to run. These files are generated by the top level `visualization/case-study.ipynb`, so that the statistical tests which are performed using the output data can inform which simulations need to be run.
